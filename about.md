**Some Kinda Something (SKS)** is a YouTube channel that focuses on 3D modeling in Blender. SKS breaks modeling projects down into weekly segments with each day (Monday to Friday) looking at a specific part of each week's scene.

### How it started:

SKS came about on a rainy Tuesday afternoon while I was browsing through YouTube looking for modeling sessions/tutorials that took entire scenes (big and small) and broke them down into small, easily digested, pieces. When I failed to find anything worth following, I decided to take my own knowledge of 3D modeling and attempt to put it to use.
